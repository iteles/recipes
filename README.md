# Recipes

For _years_ I have tried meal planning and never found a good way to do it,
for SO MANY reasons (I'm still working on it).

One of the main ones though is that I have recipes ALL over the place.
Pinterest (from the old days), eBooks, screenshots of social media posts, recipe
books (remember those? :books:) and Notes on my phone with combinations of
ingredients I think might go well together :confused:

There are SO MANY apps that manage recipes but I haven't found any yet that do
ALL the main things I'm interested in personally (in fairness ***I have not yet
searched that hard*** so if you know of one,
[please let me know](https://github.com/iteles/recipes/issues)!):
+ Add recipes from all of the resources (most let you do this :white_check_mark:)
  + Interwebs (the vast majority do this and some let you import them which is cool)
  + Offline places (not all let you do this)
+ Search easily by ingredient or title
+ Don't pollute my feed/view with a bunch of recipes I'm not interested in
+ Allow me to _rate_ recipes for myself (taste and ease of cooking)
+ Allow _others_ to rate recipes (this for me is critical in a shared household)
+ Allow me to add a bunch on notes on alterations I made/thoughts/etc

I have used a spreadsheet in the past but I really haven't enjoyed
the experience :shrug:

> I don't feel like I want to build this out as an app just yet.

I'd rather collect some recommendations from people, investigate what already
exists in this _super saturated market_ and there are many other
[apps](https://github.com/dwyl/app) I want to be spending my time instead!

But in the meantime, I plan to use github issues because:
+ I spend a lot of my days on github and the onus to switch tools is considerable
+ It's way more interactive than a spreadsheet and allows me to hash out
what I actually want from a tool within the comments of issues


For now my intention is to:
+ Open an issue for a recipe _as I make it_ (**I don't
want this to become a recipe graveyard** for things I'll never try)
+ Include in the recipe:
  + Ingredients (so that these are searchable)
  + Hashtags #mains #sides #breakfasts #vegan #makeahead etc (to be better defined
    and solidied in this readme)
  + Any alterations I propose off the bat
  + Suggestions (if I have any) for accompaniments and for other meals that
  can be effectively made in the same meal prep batch
+ Once made:
  + Add a score for taste and one for ease of making
  + Get anyone eating that meal to do the same
+ Close issues with dishes I didn't like/don't want to make again
(these remain searchable)
